Progress and Learning Log

This document is a daily record of my progress, thoughts, and learning journey as I work on building a data structures library in C. My primary goal is to practice implementing data structures while simultaneously building my skills in C programming and data structures and algorithms.

March 21st, 2025 (Friday)

Activities:

Started watching Learn C Programming and OOP with Dr. Chuck [feat. "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie]. Covered the first two chapters:

K&R 0: Historical Context

From Python to C

Gained an understanding of the historical context of C and how it compares to other programming languages like Python.

March 22nd, 2025 (Saturday)

Activities:

Watched K&R 1: A Tutorial Introduction

Began learning basic syntax and the structure of C programs.

March 23rd, 2025 (Sunday)

Activities:

Watched K&R 2: Types, Operators, and Expressions

Learned about data types, operators (precedence), and expressions used in C.

March 24th, 2025 (Monday)

Activities:

Watched K&R 3: Control Flow

Explored conditional statements, loops, and basic control flow structures in C.

March 25th, 2025 (Tuesday)

Activities:

Watched K&R 4: Functions and Program Structure

Started to grasp how to organize code into functions and how C handles function calls.

March 26th, 2025 (Wednesday)

Activities:

Watched half of K&R 5: Pointers and Arrays.

Began brainstorming how to get practice with C basics.

March 27th, 2025 (Thursday)

Activities:

Finished K&R 5: Pointers and Arrays

Finalized project: Decided to implement a C data structures library, working through Striver's A2Z DSA course, and documenting the entire process.

March 28th, 2025 (Friday)

Activities:

Finished K&R 6: Structures

The next part of Dr. Chuck's lecture requires better C and DSA knowledge, so I will continue with it once I have completed this project.

March 29th, 2025 (Saturday)

Activities:

Set up the project repository on GitHub.

Created the basic folder structure.

Wrote the initial README.md to explain the project goal and structure.

Created the initial progress.md file to document progress and next steps.

Reviewed Time and Space Complexity - Striver's A2Z DSA Course.

Key Takeaways from Time and Complexity lecture:

We use Big O notation to measure code performance because execution time varies across machines, while complexity is consistent as a function of input size.

Rule 1: Focus on the worst-case scenario because our goal is to handle the largest expected workload of our code.

Rule 2: Consider only the highest-order term in time/space function because lower degrees become insignificant with larger inputs. Kind of like limits in calc.

Important point about Space Complexity:

Avoid manipulating/tampering with input data directly, as changes may not be permissible or safe. If our task was to perform some operations on a set of data, we wouldn't do something like b = a + b even if it does save space, because that alters our original data.

Relevance to the Project:

Understanding time and space complexity is vital for optimizing the C data structures library.

Next Steps (More of a self-note to myself. I'll include next steps on days where I think I need to provide reasoning for what I'm doing):
