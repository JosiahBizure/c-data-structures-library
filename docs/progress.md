Activities:

    Started watching Learn C Programming and OOP with Dr. Chuck [feat. classic book by Kernighan and Ritchie]. Watched the first two chapters:

        K&R 0: Historical Context

        From Python to C

    Gained an understanding of the historical context of C and how it compares to other programming languages like Python.

Next Steps:

    Continue exploring the course and dive deeper into C's syntax and concepts.

March 22nd, 2025 (Saturday)

Activities:

    Watched K&R 1: A Tutorial Introduction

    Began understanding basic syntax and the structure of C programs.

Next Steps:

    Continue to learn about data types, operators, and expressions in C.

March 23rd, 2025 (Sunday)

Activities:

    Watched K&R 2: Types, Operators, and Expressions

    Learned about data types, operators, and expressions used in C.

Next Steps:

    Move on to control flow concepts in the next lesson.

March 24th, 2025 (Monday)

Activities:

    Watched K&R 3: Control Flow

    Explored conditional statements, loops, and basic control flow structures in C.

Next Steps:

    Learn more about functions and program structure in the next chapter.

March 25th, 2025 (Tuesday)

Activities:

    Watched K&R 4: Functions and Program Structure

    Started to grasp how to organize code into functions and how C handles function calls.

Next Steps:

    Move on to pointers and arrays, which will build a stronger understanding of memory and references.

March 26th, 2025 (Wednesday)

Activities:

    Watched half of K&R 5: Pointers and Arrays.

    Began brainstorming project ideas. At this point, I started thinking about building a data structures library in C, which would involve implementing various data structures (like linked lists, stacks, queues) from scratch and solving problems using those structures. This would help me practice C while learning DSA concepts in parallel.

Next Steps:

    Continue watching chapter 5 and finalize project direction.

March 27th, 2025 (Thursday)

Activities:

    Finished K&R 5: Pointers and Arrays

    Continued brainstorming the project idea and decided on implementing a C data structures library. The idea would be to work through Striver's A2Z DSA course, using C to implement the data structures needed along the way. This project would give me hands-on experience and let me document the entire process for future reference.

Next Steps:

    Move on to K&R 6: Structures and deepen my knowledge of how to manage data in C.

March 28th, 2025 (Friday)

Activities:

    Finished K&R 6: Structures

    Continued refining the project idea, thinking about how to structure the library and what features to include. I finalized the project outline and began setting up the repository on GitHub.

Next Steps:

    Set up the project on GitHub, start adding files and organizing the repository structure.

March 29th, 2025 (Saturday)

Activities:

    Set up the project repository on GitHub:

        Created the basic folder structure for the C Data Structures Library (src/, include/, tests/, docs/).

        Wrote the initial README.md to explain the project goal and structure.

        Created an initial progress.md file to document what I've done so far and where I'm going next.

Next Steps:

    Start working through Striver's A2Z Course.
