## Title: Custom Data Structures and Algorithms Library in C

### Description:
This project is a C library developed to implement fundamental data structures and algorithms from scratch. It is a hands-on approach to mastering data structures, algorithms, and low-level programming concepts in C, following the Striver's A2Z DSA course. I create each component as I encounter the need for it while solving problems, ensuring a practical understanding of each structure and algorithm implemented.

### Technologies:
- **C**: Programming language used for the implementation of data structures and algorithms.
- **Git**: Version control for managing the project.
- **Make**: Automating build process.
- **GCC**: Compiler used to compile the C code.

---

## Key Features:
- **Custom Data Structures**: Includes fundamental structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash maps, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Implements essential algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal.
- **Modular Code**: Each component is modular, promoting maintainability and scalability.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests to ensure code reliability and correctness.
- **Example Usage**: Provides example code for each structure and algorithm to demonstrate their usage.
- **Object-Oriented Principles (adapted to C)**: Although C is a procedural language, the design incorporates principles like abstraction and encapsulation for cleaner code organization.

## Project Vision / Goal:
The goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of data structures and algorithms by implementing them from scratch in C. By building a custom library, I aim to:
- Gain hands-on experience with low-level programming concepts.
- Sharpen my debugging and testing skills through rigorous unit tests.
- Apply the knowledge gained from Striver's A2Z DSA course and my C programming journey.

## Learning Milestones:
- **Learning C Basics**: Completed key chapters from *The C Programming Language* (Kernighan and Ritchie) to understand the fundamentals of C.
- **Understanding Time and Space Complexity**: Studied Big O notation and its application in analyzing code performance through Striver’s A2Z DSA course.
- **Project Planning**: Designed the project structure, including the folder layout and file organization, to ensure modularity and clarity in implementation.

---

## Project Scope:
This library will implement the following data structures and algorithms:
- **Data Structures**:
  - Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
  - Hash Tables
  - Graphs
- **Algorithms**:
  - Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
  - Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
  - Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)

The project will also include algorithms for insertion, deletion, traversal, and other operations specific to each data structure.

---

## Next Steps:
- **Implement Linked List**: Start with the creation of a basic singly linked list, implementing insert, delete, and search operations.
- **Setup Makefile**: Automate the build process using a Makefile to streamline compilation and testing.
- **Expand on Testing**: Begin adding unit tests for each data structure and algorithm as they are implemented.
- **Work through Striver’s A2Z DSA Course**: Continue to implement new structures and algorithms as they come up in the course, documenting the process.
