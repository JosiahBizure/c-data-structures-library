A C library implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms.

Title: Custom Data Structures and Algorithms Library in C

Description:
This project is a C library developed to implement fundamental data structures and algorithms from scratch. Following the A2Z DSA course, I create each component as I encounter the need for it while solving problems. The library serves as a hands-on approach to understanding data structures, algorithms, and low-level programming concepts in C.

Technologies: C, Git, Make, GCC

Key Features:

    Custom implementations of data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash maps, etc.).

    Efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal.

    Modular, well-documented code with unit tests and example usage.

    Thoughtful design inspired by OOP principles, adapted for procedural C.

Outcome:

    Demonstrated ability to develop modular and efficient C code.

    Applied OOP concepts (abstraction, encapsulation) within a procedural context.

    Gained hands-on experience with data structures and algorithm implementation.

    Enhanced debugging and testing skills through rigorous unit testing.
