# c-data-structures-library
A C library implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms.

Title: Custom Data Structures and Algorithms Library in C

Description:
This project is a C library developed to implement fundamental data structures and algorithms from scratch. Following the A2Z DSA course, I create each component as I encounter the need for it while solving problems. The library serves as a hands-on approach to understanding data structures, algorithms, and low-level programming concepts in C.

Technologies: C, Git, Make, GCC

Key Features:

    Custom implementations of data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash maps, etc.).

    Efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal.

    Modular, well-documented code with unit tests and example usage.

    Thoughtful design inspired by OOP principles, adapted for procedural C.

Outcome:

    Demonstrated ability to develop modular and efficient C code.

    Applied OOP concepts (abstraction, encapsulation) within a procedural context.

    Gained hands-on experience with data structures and algorithm implementation.

    Enhanced debugging and testing skills through rigorous unit testing.


Project Vision/Goal: Why you’re building this library, what you aim to learn, and how it ties into your DSA and C programming journey.

Learning Milestones: Summarize what you've done so far:

    Learning C basics (mention the course and the chapters you covered).

    Understanding Time and Space Complexity (mention Striver’s A2Z DSA).

    Planning the project structure (folder layout, file organization).

Project Scope: Outline the types of data structures you plan to implement (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables).

Next Steps: What you plan to tackle next (e.g., implementing basic linked list functions, setting up Makefile).
